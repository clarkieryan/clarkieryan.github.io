    			<h3>The Rainbow Venues</h3>
    			<p>Working with Dontfret Media, we created an elegant solution for The Rainbow Venues. They wanted a completely self-sufficient event management system, we decided to use wordpress and then with heavy customisation we created post types for events and venues. The client, then wanted the site to link in with a ticket purchasing system. We also developed a photo gallery which pulls in their latest photos from Facebook and made the entire website mobile-friendly!</p>

    			<h3>Smints</h3>
    			<p>As part of a smaller project I had a need to use a static menu that locked onto the top of a page, for this I decided to use <a href="http://www.outyear.co.uk/smint/">smint</a> – a small JQuery plugin developed by <a href="http://twitter.com/rabmyself">Robert McCracken</a>. However I felt it needed some extra functionality so I adapted it. I changed the plugin to add a class to the menu item that’s currently inside the active area. You can check out a demo <a href="http://clarkieryan.github.io/smints">here</a> and the code is <a href="https://github.com/clarkieryan/smints">here</a>.</p>
    			<p>
    				Success! This code has been added to the official release

    			<h3>1st Bedworth Scout Group</h3>
    			<p>1st Bedworth was looking for a site that allowed them to easily update yet looked modern. To do this I worked with a number of members from the group to develop the solution that is currently in place. We used a responsive template to deliver the content with stylings similar to the scouting associations own branding. I developed a side bar calendar that linked up with the groups own Google calendar, and a photo gallery plugin where the parents and members can view photos taken from events the group hold.</p>

    			<h3>Olicana Jewellery</h3>
    			<p>Working with a designer, I developed an e-commerce system for Olicana Jewellery. To do this I used a mixture of WordPress and the Woo-Commerce plugin for wordpress, to deliver a basic e-commerce solution. Using the Woo-Commerce plugin I override the basic views to allow the layout the designer envisioned..</p>
