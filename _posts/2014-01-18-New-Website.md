# New website design

So I wasn't a big fan of my old design, so I went for a much cleaner version of the old site. The design of this new site is similar to the old version, but I feel it's a lot cleaner and simpler design.

### Technology used
To develop this site I have used a mixture of Grunt to automate the processing of my SASS css and the jeckll files. Using Grunt really sped up the process of minification of any scripts and the css files used on the website. This was ideal as it allowed me to learn a lot about the use of these new technologies, this cleaner work flow allowed to me to develop a site in a less time than what it would of have normally of have taken. The website is fully responsive, and looks great at all sizes.
