title: Tonight - My Dissertation! 
excerpt: I've been pretty quiet over the past few months as it's been time for my dissertation, for my major project I have decided to develop a mobile application that allows you to discover events happening around you. The main premise being a feed of events that are suggested to you by use of suggestion algorithms from what other people have enjoyed. The algorithm is much like the one being used by Amazon to suggest products that you may also be interested in. You will also be able to discover events that are happening around a particular city filtered by the genre or venue it's based at!

#Tonight - My Dissertation

I've been pretty quiet over the past few months as it's been time for my dissertation, for my major project I have decided to develop a mobile application that allows you to discover events happening around you. The main premise being a feed of events that are suggested to you by use of suggestion algorithms from what other people have enjoyed. The algorithm is much like the one being used by Amazon to suggest products that you may also be interested in. You will also be able to discover events that are happening around a particular city filtered by the genre or venue it's based at! 

I have seen quite a few of these event aggregation applications pop up recently, however they all specify on a particular city or type of events. I have specifically developed mine to be able to read in data from loads of different sources so it's not limited to a particular place or genre type. I'm primarily utilising various API's such as Facebook and Ticketmaster as a data source then using some intelligent processing to categorise these and output them via a REST API. 

Overall I'm happy with progress and developed a pretty awesome app so far, just need to clean up the code and write the 20,000 word report that goes along with it.
