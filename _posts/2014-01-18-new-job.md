# New Job! 

I am soon to graduate and as part of that I need to enter the real world and get a job! It was a bit early but last week I went to an  interview at Inspired Gaming (my first programming based interview), the next day I got a phone call with a job offer! 

So 3 months time I will be commuting to Birmingham and starting as a mobile developer. Primarily they are developing in Javascript/HTML5/CSS3 and creating responsive games to be called via the web browser. I have written JavaScript in the past and understand some of it's quirks but not still only intermediate at it. Because of this I have tasked myself to become a JSNinja in the next 3 months. Learning everything I possibly can about the language. Every week I will put up a blog post about what I have learnt and a little something to show that, be it a game or something else.
